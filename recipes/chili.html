    <h2>Homemade Chili con carne</h2>
    <p>This great chilli recipe has to be one of the best dishes to serve to friends for a casual get-together. An easy sharing favourite that uses up storecupboard ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>1 red pepper</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato pur√©e</li>
        <li>410g can red kidney beans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.</li>
        <li>Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.</li>
        <li>Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice.</li>
    </ol>
